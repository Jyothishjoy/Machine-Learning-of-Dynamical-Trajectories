Machine Learning for Iron-Oxo Complex Dynamics

This repository contains the code and resources used in our study for understanding the dynamical origin of rebound versus dissociation selectivity in biologically relevant iron-oxo complexes. Our work, as detailed in our published article, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c09891, employs robust machine learning models to unravel complex chemical reactions.

Overview

Iron-oxo complexes play a crucial role in various biological and chemical processes. Analyzing their dynamic behavior, particularly the factors influencing rebound versus dissociation pathways, is essential for a deeper understanding of these reactions. We leverage machine learning techniques to tackle this challenge, providing new insights into the mechanistic pathways of these complexes.
